.TH _PRINTF 3 "2024-01-01" "1.0" "Holberton School Library Functions Manual"
.SH NAME
_printf \- formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include "main.h"
.sp
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR _printf ()
function produces output according to a
.I format
as described below. This function writes output to
.IR stdout ,
the standard output stream.
.PP
The
.BR _printf ()
function writes the output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.
.SS Format of the format string
The format string is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), and conversion specifications.
.PP
Each conversion specification is introduced by the character
.BR % ,
and ends with a
.IR "conversion specifier" .
.SS The conversion specifiers
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meaning are:
.TP
.B c
A character is written.
.TP
.B s
The
.I "const char *"
argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\\0').
.TP
.B d, i
The
.I int
argument is converted to integer notation.
.TP
.B %
A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.
. SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
.PP
If an error occurs, a negative value is returned.
.SH EXAMPLES
To print a date and time in the form "Sunday, July 3, 10:02", where
.I weekday
and
.I month
are pointers to strings:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
#include "main.h"

_printf("%s, %s %d, %.2d:%.2d\\n",
	weekday, month, day, hour, min);
.EE
.in
.PP
To print a character:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
_printf("Character: %c\\n", 'A');
.EE
.in
.SH NOTES
The
.BR _printf ()
function is a simplified implementation and does not support all features of the standard
.BR printf (3)
function.
.PP
For unknown conversion specifiers, the function prints the '%' characte2r followed by the specifier character
.SH BUGS
No known bugs.
