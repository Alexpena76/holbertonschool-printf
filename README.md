# This project implements a simplified version of the printf function in C. The _printf function produces output according to a format string and writes output to the standard output stream (stdout). It handles various conversion specifiers and returns the number of characters printed. The implementation follows the Betty coding style and includes comprehensive error handling for edge cases such as NULL pointers and integer overflow conditions.
